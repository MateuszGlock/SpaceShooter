          Welcome to "The Maverick's Odyssey"!<br /><br />

          Controls:<br />
          - Move your spaceship: Use the mouse to navigate the galaxy. The ship
          follows the movement of the cursor.<br />
          - Shoot enemies: Click the left mouse button to unleash powerful shots
          and defend against hostile forces.<br />
          - Pause the adventure: Press the "Escape" key to pause the game and
          access the pause menu.<br />
          - Explore upgrades: Press "E" to open the upgrades menu, where you can
          enhance your spaceship's capabilities.<br /><br />

          Objective:<br />
          Embark on a cosmic journey filled with challenges and adversaries.
          Your mission is to survive and thrive by shooting down enemy ships,
          collecting gears, and earning points.<br /><br />

          Game Elements:<br />
          - Stars: Watch out for celestial obstacles as you navigate through the
          galaxy.<br />
          - Enemies: Battle against hostile alien ships to secure your path.<br />
          - Gears: Collect gears to enhance your spaceship's abilities and
          purchase upgrades.<br />
          - Healthkits: Grab healthkits to replenish your spaceship's health and

          Upgrades:<br />
          Visit the upgrades menu to spend your hard-earned gears on improving
          your spaceship. The best moment for upgrading your ship is between
          waves, as it may took some time. Enhance your firepower, boost your
          engines, and upgrade your bullets for a more formidable journey.<br /><br />

          Scoring:<br />
          - Defeat enemies: Each enemy ship you destroy adds points to your
          score.<br />
          - Collect gears: Accumulate gears to unlock and purchase upgrades in
          the upgrades menu.<br /><br />

          Health:<br />
          Monitor your spaceship's health indicated at the top of the screen.
          Avoid enemy attacks to maintain your vitality. The game ends if your
          health reaches zero.<br /><br />

          The Maverick's Odyssey awaits you! May the stars guide your journey
          through the cosmos.
